# Software Engineering Books Collection

Hi folks, previously, I'd used this repo to store my collection of software engineering books 📚. But due to the LFS limitation, I had to move all of my collection to the Notion page 🏠.

**Check it out [HERE 🏠](https://ad0x99.notion.site/Software-Engineering-Books-79393ebad65a4c68bd4786d27ec65365) or in the description section of this repo**

All the books in this repo had been **🔥DELETED🔥** and I only **KEEP** this `README` file to update the information related to this repo.

I'll be **UPDATING** new books on the Notion page, which I believe will give you more convenience ✨ to find the book you want.

**THANKS** for supporting this repo 🫶!
